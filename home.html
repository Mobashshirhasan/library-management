	About Hostel<br>
Al-Falah University offers comprehensive hostel facilities within the campus for Boys and outside the campus for Girls. Every effort has been made by us to provide the best facilities for the hostellers.

Boys and Girls have been provided with independent hostels along with all modern amenities and facilities. We offers separate magnificent hostel for boys in the college campus with hostel warden in each hostel to supervise day to day management.

Hostel accommodation is however considered on the basis of both need and availability. The decision of the hostel committee in this matter shall be final and binding on all students. Hostel rules have been framed keeping in mind the local culture and traditions, with a view to guide and help students to attain standards of implacable conduct.

Therefore, while residents enjoy the maximum freedom, it is ensured that this is always within the framework of standard guidelines and procedures. Several hostel activities are organized during the academic session.
